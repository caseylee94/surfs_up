## Challenge Overview

The purpose of this challenge is to use advanced data retrieval and storage to pull information from weather data sites to determine the feasibility of opening an ice cream and surf shop in Oahu, Hawaii. It is important to the main investor, W. Avy, to look deeply into the weather patterns because weather is an integral part of the success of both of these business ventures. The data-driven decisions that we will make will be based on temperature for the past 7 years from 2010-2017, specifically June and December. These 2 months are far apart enough to ensure we have good conditions year-round.

## Results

The summary statistics for temperature for each month were found using Jupyter Notebook. The results for the month of June are shown below:
