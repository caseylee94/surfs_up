## Challenge Overview

The purpose of this challenge is to use advanced data retrieval and storage to pull information from weather data sites to determine the feasibility of opening an ice cream and surf shop in Oahu, Hawaii. It is important to the main investor, W. Avy, to look deeply into the weather patterns because weather is an integral part of the success of both of these business ventures. The data-driven decisions that we will make will be based on temperature for the past 7 years from 2010-2017, specifically June and December. These 2 months are far apart enough to ensure we have good conditions year-round.

## Results

The summary statistics for temperature for each month were found using Jupyter Notebook. The results for the month of June are shown below:

 The same analysis was performed for the month of December and are shown below:

* The average temperature for June is 75F and the average temperature for December is 5% lower at 71F
* The December temperatures seem to be more variable than those in June given its larger range in recorded temperatures (comparing the max vs min temp of each month)
* The minimum temperature in December will have the biggest impact on the business at 56F

## Summary 

Even though the temperatures in December have a wider range and are overall lower than June, I do not think the difference is so drastic that it would hurt the business enough to make it not feasible. The average temperatures are close together with only a 5% difference. The ice cream sales would be more affected than the surf business on the particularly colder days, especially if the temperature drops into the 50sF. The business could choose to stock less ice cream during the winter months to help cut down on losses this may cause.
